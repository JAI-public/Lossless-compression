# Design Documents
The decompress library does not depend on other jaids libraries and works independently. As of Ver1.0.0, only the static library version has been released.

## How to build

This tool uses CMake to build.

```
$git clone https://github.com/jai-rd/lossless_compression
$cd lossless_compression
$lossless_compression>mkdir build
$build>cmake -S . -B build -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
$lossless_compression>cd build
$lossless_compression>make
```

When the build is complete, `liblossless.lib` is created in `build/bin/Release`.<br>
