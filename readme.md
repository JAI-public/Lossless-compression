# Decompression Library for Xpress (ImageCompressionMode)

JAI's own Lossless compression algorithm reduces and fully restores image data without loss of data. As a result, the output frame rate can be increased.

![ImageCompressionMode](https://github.com/JAI-public/Lossless-compression/assets/105468045/90baae2b-caf7-46b6-a7ba-5bcf37460d18)

When image data is compressed by Image Compression Mode, the output format is no longer in Pixel Format's format (Mono8 or Bayer8). Therefore, the standard tools such as eBUS SDK for JAI will not display the compressed image correctly. Use Decompression Library to restore compressed image on the software you use. 

**Notes**: For more information on how to use Xpress (ImageCompressionMode), see the user manual available at the JAI product page (www.jai.com).
